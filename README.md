The attached files (PDFs and Power Point Presentations) cover various subjects related to magnetic circuit design. A Python program with GUI (Chan_model.py) has been developed to reproduce Chan's model, enabling the simulation of magnetic hysteresis BH-loops in cores without a gap. For more information on Chan's model, please refer to: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/75630

This model is used for simulating non-linear behaviour of transformers in LTspice: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/simulating-non-linear-transformers-in-ltspice/ See the attached report "A case study on magnetic cores_All files.pdf".

Output files of Chan_model.py (algorithm with GUI): "BH-loop_data.csv" and "Averaged_BH-loop_data.csv". Input parameters from the previous program run are saved in "simulation_log.log" and can be called from GUI.

"Magnetic circuits.ppsx" is a Power Point Slide Show (PPS) on magnetic circuits. It can be seen after downloading.
